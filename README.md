# IP Address Calculator

This project is a simple IP Address Calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to calculate the network address, broadcast address, and the number of available hosts based on a given IP address and subnet mask.

## Features

- Input validation for IP addresses in decimal format (0-255).
- Support for subnet masks in both decimal format (e.g., 255.255.255.0) and CIDR notation (e.g., /24).
- Calculates and displays:
  - Network Address
  - Broadcast Address
  - Available Hosts
